    "**Problem with standard INT4**:\n",
    "- Neural network weights follow a **normal distribution** (bell curve)\n",
    "- Most values are near zero\n",
    "- INT4 wastes bins on extreme values\n",
    "\n",
    "**NF4 Solution**: \n",
    "```\n",
    "Design quantization bins specifically for normal distribution!\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of: [-8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n",
