Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8. Connectivity for societal transformation, \\n \\n9. Defending the nation: Our pride and \\n \\n10. Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a que stion from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”. I \\nappreciated the question and said it was indeed a thoughtful question and as sured her that \\nthat her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and we would work', metadata={'source': 'apjspeech.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='for it to achieve before 2020. This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth', metadata={'source': 'apjspeech.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Let me now share with you, the enriching experience I had, whil e meeting more than \\n6000 farmers from different States and Union Territories visitin g Rashtrapati Bhavan. \\nThey evinced keen interest in the Mughal Gardens, the Herbal Gardens , the Spiritual \\nGarden, the Musical Garden, the Bio-diesel garden and the Nutrition Garden and interact \\nwith the Horticultural specialists. Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers.

      "Speech:APJ Abdul Kalam's departing speech as the President of India is a heartfelt thank you to the nation for the opportunity to serve. He is grateful for the association and support he received from people from various walks of life, including politicians, scientists, academics, artists, and the youth. During his five-year tenure, he shared several experiences that conveyed the following message:\n",
      "\n",
      " **Accelerate development**: He emphasized the importance of the youth's aspirations in driving the country's progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be from President Pratibha Patil of India, delivered in 2006 or later. The speech outlines 10 key messages. \n",
      "\n",
      "The first message mentions a question from a young girl named Anukriti, who asked why India couldn't become a developed nation by 2020. This is a call to accelerate development and achieve the aspirations of the youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next 9 messages focus on the following areas:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Empowering villages\n",
      "2. Mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness\n",
      "3. Agricultural growth (from seed to food)\n",
      "4. Overcoming problems through partnership\n",
      "5. Courage in the face of calamities\n",
      "6. Connectivity for societal transformation\n",

      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech emphasizes the need for India to become a developed nation by 2020 and highlights key areas that need to be addressed to achieve this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be a response to a question asked by Anukriti about why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020. The speaker appreciates the question, acknowledges it as thoughtful, and assures Anukriti that her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and worked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be from President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, possibly during his presidency in India. Here's a summary of the given excerpt:\n",
      "\n",
      "The President notes that the desire to live in a developed India has become a common aspiration among the youth, with over 15 lakh (1.5 million) young people he has met sharing this dream. He believes that the aspirations of the youth, to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud India, should guide professionals in their contributions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President also shares a personal experience from his visit to Nagaland in 2002, where he saw an empowered village council functioning with financial powers and taking decisions. However, he notes that there is still a need to provide physical connectivity to the village for further development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the importance of rural development in India, specifically in terms of vegetables production and connectivity. The speaker mentions a meeting that highlighted the potential for transformation in 600,000 Indian villages if they are empowered and well-connected. \n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker then focuses on the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women's initiative, known as PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas), which aims to bring urban amenities to 65 rural villages. The initiative provides three types of connectivity: physical, electronic, and knowledge, leading to economic connectivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the achievements of Periyar PURA, a development project. Key points include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Periyar PURA has established various facilities such as healthcare centers, education institutions, and vocational training centers, leading to employment generation and entrepreneurship.\n",
      "2. The project has transformed 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land, enabling villagers to engage in activities like farming, Jatropha plantations, and power generation.\n",
      "3. Villagers have set up marketing centers and are involved in food processing and other activities, providing a sustainable economic development model for the region.\n",
      "4. Over the last eight months, villagers have collaborated with experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) and Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women to develop products using local raw materials and core competencies available in Thanjavur district.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is highlighting the success of a PURA (Provision for Urban Rural Area) initiative in Thanjavur district. With the help of JETRO specialists and feedback from exhibitions, the people of 65 villages developed 55 internationally competitive lifestyle products. This has enhanced their innovative abilities and enabled them to produce internationally acceptable products. The speaker believes that to bridge the rural-urban divide, the country needs around 7,000 such PURAs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shared their experience meeting over 6000 farmers from various states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan. The farmers showed interest in the gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker also mentioned a recent address to agricultural scientists, where they discussed practical suggestions from farmers to double agricultural production with limited resources and improve the nation's economy through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. The goal is to empower farmers to protect the land for a second green revolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be by a speaker who met with farmers, scientists, and industries to discuss increasing agricultural GDP growth. They express confidence that the nation can achieve at least a 4% annual growth through the partnership of these groups. The speaker then shares a personal experience from a meeting with a man named Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who is a wheelchair user due to being born without hands and legs. The speaker was inspired by the man's happiness and positivity, but the context does not explicitly mention a connection between this experience and the rest of the speech, which seems to focus on agricultural development.\n",
      "\n",
      "A person with physical challenges was being praised for his confidence and talent. He had been encouraged by his parents, teachers, and others, which helped his latent talent for music blossom. He wanted to share his music with others, and through his hard work and perseverance, he was able to perform at a prestigious event, the Rashtra pati Bhavan art theatre, in July 2007. This story is being used to convey a message of overcoming challenges through partnership and support.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker had the opportunity to visit Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir in 2005, just after a devastating earthquake. They observed the damage to the school building but were impressed by the resilience and courage of the villagers, particularly the children. The speaker praised the efforts of the Army, Air Force, and state government in providing relief and medical aid, and noted that the people of Urusa have shown remarkable strength in overcoming their problems despite suffering significant losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker met with villagers and children who were participating in a relief operation after an earthquake. They reported that despite the challenges, the children were smiling and participating bravely. The speaker also witnessed a successful on-the-spot settlement of relief grants to victims by the acting Chief Justice and state authorities. The speaker is impressed by the courage shown by the citizens in the face of severe challenges, and mentions a similar experience in 2005 when visiting the Car Nicobar Islands after a disaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be about a personal experience of the speaker visiting the Car-Nicobar islanders after the 2004 Tsunami. Despite suffering heavy losses, the tribal islanders showed remarkable courage by taking in affected victims as their own, effectively creating a community system without the need for orphanages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moved by their resilience, the speaker composed a poem called \"Sea Waves\" which the islanders sang with enthusiasm, showing their courage and determination despite their suffering. The poem expresses the idea that with faith and the power of the Almighty, they can overcome challenges. \n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also mentions the speaker addressing the Pan African Parliament on September 16, 2004, but the content of that part is not provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "On September 16, 2004, the speaker proposed the Pan African e-Network to connect 53 African countries at a cost of $100 million. The network will provide seamless internet connectivity through satellite, fiber optics, and wireless connections. The project aims to connect:\n",

      "\n",
      "A pilot project has already been launched in Ethiopia, with the Indira Gandhi National Open University offering an MBA course to 34 Ethiopian students. Specialists from India's CARE Hospital are also participating in the tele-medicine project.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be from Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the 11th President of India. He mentions the following achievements and experiences:\n",
      "\n",

      "The speech is about the efforts and dedication of the Indian Defence Forces and para-military forces. The speaker highlights their bravery, commitment, and devotion to duty, even in adverse circumstances. They mention their opportunities to interact with these forces and appreciate their role in safeguarding the nation and its citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the efforts of the Lead India 2020 Foundation, founded by Dr. N.B. Sudershan in Hyderabad. The foundation provides training to thousands of students in various districts of Andhra Pradesh, in partnership with the District Administration. \n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights a specific example from the Medak district, where students have shown improvement in self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers, overcoming stage fear, and understanding their duties towards the nation. \n",
      "\n",
      "It also shares a personal story of Ms. Padma, a student leader, who took the initiative to change her father's behavior after learning the 10-point oath, successfully preventing him from smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is expressing confidence in the youth of their country, believing they are on the right path due to a mission-oriented program. They mention a specific instance where a young person inspired their father to quit smoking after attending a leadership training camp. The speaker then highlights the potential of India's 540 million youth below the age of 25, considering them a powerful resource, and emphasizes the importance of empowering them through value-based education and leadership. The speech concludes with the speaker being inspired by the cultural diversity and unity of India, citing examples of its rich tradition.\n",
      "\n",

They believe it's the duty of the current generation to preserve these treasures for future generations. The speaker highlights the country's progress in the past 60 years, its natural resources, and the hardworking people, particularly the 540 million youth. They express confidence that India can become a developed nation before 2020 and encourage people to strive to empower citizens who are willing to contribute to the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes the importance of empowering members of society, particularly the youth.

       "'After reviewing the additional context, I have refined the original summary as follows:\\n\\nIn his departure speech, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam expresses gratitude to the people of India and those abroad for their association during his five-year tenure as President. He highlights the diverse groups he interacted with, from politics and science to academia and the youth community. Kalam emphasizes the importance of accelerating development, driven by the aspirations of the youth. A poignant question from a young girl, Anukriti, who asked why India cannot become a developed nation before 2020, prompts Kalam to reflect on the nation\\'s potential and the need for collective action to achieve this goal. Kalam assures Anukriti that her dream will be taken to the highest institution of the nation, emphasizing the commitment to make her vision a reality.\\n\\nHe further stresses the importance of the youth\\'s desire to live in a developed India, which is echoed by over fifteen lakh youth whom he has met. Kalam believes that the aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud India should guide the nation\\'s progress. To achieve this goal, Kalam proposes several key strategies, including:\\n\\n- Empowering villages, as exemplified by initiatives like Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women\\'s PURA complex, which has successfully created a sustainable economic development model for the region by providing urban amenities, establishing healthcare centers, vocational training centers, and transforming waste land into cultivable land.\\n- Cultivating agricultural growth through \"Seed to Food,\" an initiative focused on developing the entire agricultural value chain, from planting seeds to processing and marketing food products.\\n- Enhancing rural innovation and entrepreneurship through PURA initiatives, which have already been successfully implemented in many states, enabling rural communities to develop and produce internationally competitive products.\\n- Overcoming challenges through partnership and showcasing courage in the face of calamities, as exemplified by his visit to Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, which was recovering from the devastating earthquake in 2005, and his experience with Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a person with no hands and legs, who remained positive and inspired others through his music.\\n\\nMoreover, Kalam shares his experience of visiting Chuckchucha village in the Car Nicobar Islands, where he witnessed the remarkable resilience and courage of the Car-Nicobar islanders, particularly in the face of the devastating 2004 Tsunami. Despite the severe human losses, the islanders had taken the affected victims as their children, exemplifying their strong sense of community and compassion. Inspired by their courage, Kalam composed a poem called \"Sea Waves,\" which was sung by the villagers with great enthusiasm and solidarity. This experience highlights the importance of community and collective action in overcoming even the most severe challenges.\\n\\nKalam also emphasizes the importance of defending the nation, expressing pride in the bravery and dedication of the Indian Armed Forces. He highlights the exceptional courage and skill of the Indian soldiers, sailors, and air warriors, showcasing his appreciation for the sacrifices made by the Defence Forces. Kalam shares his experiences of presenting colors to many regiments, participating in passing out parades, and interacting with family members of the Defence Forces, para-military forces, and internal security forces who have made immense contributions to the nation\\'s safety and security. He expresses gratitude for the valour, commitment, and devotion to duty of these forces.\\n\\nFurthermore, Kalam emphasizes the need to preserve India\\'s rich and diverse cultural and civilizational heritage, which is a duty owed to future generations. He expresses confidence that with the country\\'s natural resources, progress in the last sixty years, and the power of the 540 million youth, India can become a developed nation well before 2020.

Sudershan in Hyderabad, which is training thousands of students in various districts of Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the District Administration. He mentions the transformation that has taken place among the students of Medak district, who have shown self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers, and a shedding of stage fear. Kalam also talks about Ms. Padma, a student leader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda, who has weaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of the 10-point oath from the Lead India Training Camp. This gives Kalam an assurance that the youth of the country are on the right path through this mission-oriented program.\\n\\nKalam concludes by quoting a famous poem, \"When you wish upon a star, Makes no difference who you are, Anything your heart desires, Will come to you,” emphasizing that the youth\\'s aspirations can become a reality if they aim high.

He believes that with the collective efforts of the nation, the youth can drive India\\'s transformation into a developed nation by 2020. Finally, Kalam expresses his gratitude to the people of India for their love and support during his tenure and concludes by sharing his mission to bring connectivity between billion hearts and minds of the people of India and to embed the self-confidence that \"we can do it\".'"
