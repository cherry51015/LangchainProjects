    "## The Big Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Problem Are We Solving?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're building a chatbot that can answer questions about documents. The basic version is simple:\n",
    "- User asks: \"What is task decomposition?\"\n",
    "- Bot searches documents → finds answer → responds\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if the user follows up with: \"What are common ways of doing it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"it\" refers to \"task decomposition\" from the previous question! A basic chatbot would be confused because it has no memory. This notebook solves that problem by creating a **conversational retrieval system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Journey\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Question\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Does this question reference previous conversation? \n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Reformulate question to be standalone (using history)\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Search documents\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Generate answer (with context + history)\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Store conversation in memory\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Retrieval Chain** (Old School)\n",
    "This is the basic pattern you probably know:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "question → retrieve_documents → generate_answer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem:** It can't handle follow-up questions like \"What about it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **History-Aware Retrieval** (New!)\n",
    "This is where things get interesting:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "question + chat_history → reformulate_question → retrieve_documents → generate_answer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Magic:** Before searching, we reformulate vague questions into clear ones using conversation history.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Session Management**\n",
    "Conversations need memory. We use:\n",
    "- **Session ID**: A unique identifier (like \"abc123\") for each conversation\n",
    "- **Store**: A dictionary that holds all conversation histories\n",
    "- **Message History**: The actual back-and-forth messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a filing cabinet:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Store {\n",
    "    \"abc123\": [msg1, msg2, msg3],  # User John's conversation\n",
    "    \"xyz789\": [msg1, msg2],         # User Jane's conversation\n",
    "}\n",

    "### 🔧 **1. create_history_aware_retriever()**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Location in code:** Line 329\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:**\n",
    "Wraps your retriever to make it \"aware\" of conversation history. Before retrieving documents, it reformulates the question to be standalone.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Signature:**\n",
    "```python\n",

    "    llm,                    # The language model\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mental Model:**\n",
    "Think of it as a translator that sits between the user and your retriever.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User: \"What about it?\"\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Translator (uses history): \"Oh, they're asking about task decomposition!\"\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Retriever searches for: \"What are common ways of doing task decomposition?\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Without history awareness:\n",
    "User: \"What are common ways of doing it?\"\n",
    "Retriever searches: \"common ways doing it\" ❌ (meaningless!)\n",
    "\n",
    "# With history awareness:\n",
    "User: \"What are common ways of doing it?\"\n",
    "History: [\"What is task decomposition?\"]\n",
    "Reformulated: \"What are common ways of doing task decomposition?\" ✅\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it exists:**\n",
    "Because follow-up questions often use pronouns (it, that, them) or implicit context. Without reformulation, your retriever would search for gibberish.\n",
